You need to run `pip uninstall mmcv` first if you have mmcv installed.
If mmcv and mmcv-full are both installed, there will be `ModuleNotFoundError`.

- "No module named 'mmcv.ops'"; "No module named 'mmcv.\_ext'".

  1. Uninstall existing mmcv in the environment using `pip uninstall mmcv`.
  2. Install mmcv-full following the [installation instruction](get_started#best-practices).

## How to know the number of GPUs needed to train the model

- Infer from the name of the config file of the model. You can refer to the `Config Name Style` part of [Learn about Configs](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/master/docs/en/tutorials/config.md). For example, for config file with name `segformer_mit-b0_8x1_1024x1024_160k_cityscapes.py`, `8x1` means training the model corresponding to it needs 8 GPUs, and the batch size of each GPU is 1.
- Infer from the log file. Open the log file of the model and search `nGPU` in the file. The number of figures following `nGPU` is the number of GPUs needed to train the model. For instance, searching for `nGPU` in the log file yields the record `nGPU 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7`, which indicates that eight GPUs are needed to train the model.

## What does the auxiliary head mean

Briefly, it is a deep supervision trick to improve the accuracy. In the training phase, `decode_head` is for decoding semantic segmentation output, `auxiliary_head` is just adding an auxiliary loss, the segmentation result produced by it has no impact to your model's result, it just works in training. You may read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01105.pdf) for more information.

## Why is the log file not created

In the train script, we call `get_root_logger`at Line 167, and `get_root_logger` in mmseg calls `get_logger` in mmcv, mmcv will return the same logger which has beed initialized in 'mmsegmentation/tools/train.py' with the parameter `log_file`. There is only one logger (initialized with `log_file`) during training.

If you find the log file not been created, you might check if `mmcv.utils.get_logger` is called elsewhere.

## How to output the image for painting the segmentation mask when running the test script

In the test script, we provide `show-dir` argument to control whether output the painted images. Users might run the following command:

```shell
python tools/test.py {config} {checkpoint} --show-dir {/path/to/save/image} --opacity 1
```
